OBJECTIVE:
Fix the "Course info: 1 invalid item detected" error in Google's Rich Results Test by removing or correcting conflicting schema markup.
STEP 1: LOCATE CONFLICTING SCHEMA
Search your HTML for these potential conflicting schema types:
html<!-- Look for and REMOVE or FIX these schema types: -->
<script type="application/ld+json">
{
  "@type": "Course"
  // or
  "@type": "LearningResource"
  // or
  "@type": "EducationalResource"
}
</script>
STEP 2: COMMON LOCATIONS TO CHECK
A. In the <head> section:
Look for multiple <script type="application/ld+json"> blocks and ensure only these remain:
KEEP THIS (Your working FAQ schema):
html<script type="application/ld+json">
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "FAQPage",
  "mainEntity": [...]
}
</script>
KEEP THIS (Your article schema):
html<script type="application/ld+json">
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "Article",
  "headline": "Know What You're Dealing With",
  // ... other article properties
}
</script>
B. In navigation or breadcrumb sections:
Look for schema that might be treating the guide as a "Course":
REMOVE or FIX:
html<!-- If you find something like this, remove it -->
<script type="application/ld+json">
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "Course",
  "name": "Race Training Guide"
}
</script>
STEP 3: SPECIFIC FIXES
Option 1: Remove Course Schema (Recommended)
If you find Course-related schema, simply delete the entire <script type="application/ld+json"> block containing "@type": "Course".
Option 2: Fix Course Schema (Advanced)
If you want to keep course-like structure, ensure it's properly formatted:
html<script type="application/ld+json">
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "Course",
  "name": "BraceCraft Race Training Guide",
  "description": "Athletic plantar fasciitis management guide",
  "provider": {
    "@type": "Organization",
    "name": "BraceCraft"
  },
  "courseCode": "PF-RACE-GUIDE",
  "educationalLevel": "Intermediate"
}
</script>
STEP 4: BREADCRUMB SCHEMA CHECK
Ensure your breadcrumb schema (if present) doesn't conflict:
CORRECT breadcrumb format:
html<script type="application/ld+json">
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "BreadcrumbList",
  "itemListElement": [{
    "@type": "ListItem",
    "position": 1,
    "name": "Home",
    "item": "https://bracecrft.com"
  }, {
    "@type": "ListItem",
    "position": 2,
    "name": "Plantar Fasciitis",
    "item": "https://bracecraft.com/plantar-fasciitis"
  }, {
    "@type": "ListItem",
    "position": 3,
    "name": "Know What You're Dealing With"
  }]
}
</script>
STEP 5: CLEAN HTML STRUCTURE
Also check for inline schema attributes that might conflict:
Remove these if found:
html<!-- Remove course-related microdata -->
<div itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Course">
<span itemprop="courseCode">...</span>
