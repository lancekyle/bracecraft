# Race Training with Plantar Fasciitis: The Runner's Complete Guide

---

## Introduction

You've trained for months. Your race is approaching. And then it hits—that sharp, stabbing pain in your heel that makes you wonder if your race goals are about to disappear.

**You're not alone, and you don't have to give up.**

Most plantar fasciitis advice treats you like someone who can simply "take a break" from running. Rest until it feels better. Avoid high-impact activities. Maybe try some gentle stretching. This approach ignores a fundamental reality: **competitive runners don't have the luxury of indefinite rest.**

You have races on the calendar. Training partners counting on you. Personal goals that matter. The standard advice—while well-intentioned—doesn't account for athletes who need to maintain fitness and race readiness while managing plantar fasciitis.

**This guide is different.**

It's written specifically for runners who refuse to let plantar fasciitis derail their competitive goals. You'll learn how to modify your training intelligently, maintain race fitness, and execute your race plans while managing symptoms effectively.

**The core principle is simple: Smart training beats stopped training.**

Every modification, every strategy, and every recommendation in this guide serves one purpose: keeping you race-ready while respecting your foot's current limitations. You don't have to choose between your plantar fasciitis and your race goals—you just need to be strategic about pursuing both.

**What You'll Learn:**

- Why standard plantar fasciitis advice fails athletes and what to do instead
- How to assess your condition and make intelligent training decisions
- Race distance-specific training modifications that maintain fitness
- Smart cross-training and surface strategies that reduce plantar fascia stress
- Gear decisions that prioritize race completion over optimal recovery
- Data-driven training load management that prevents setbacks
- Race day execution tactics for competing with plantar fasciitis

**This isn't about managing a limitation—it's about executing an intelligent approach that gets you to the finish line healthy and strong.**

Your race goals don't have to wait. Let's get you there.

## About the Author

After years of battling the frustration and pain of trying to run marathons and compete in triathlons with Plantar Fasciitis, I reached my breaking point. Determined to find a solution, I sought out the best treatment practices and found an approach that worked.

That experience inspired me to team up with the doctor who helped me recover. Together, we founded BraceCraft—an approach built on over a decade of clinical experience, the latest scientific research, and collaboration with other leading doctors and physical therapists.

We know this program works, and we're confident it can work for you too. With patience and persistence, you can reclaim your active lifestyle—just like I did.
