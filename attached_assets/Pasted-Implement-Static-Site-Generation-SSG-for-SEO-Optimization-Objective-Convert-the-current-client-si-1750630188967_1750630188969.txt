Implement Static Site Generation (SSG) for SEO Optimization
Objective:
Convert the current client-side rendered React application to Static Site Generation (SSG) to solve critical SEO issues and enable proper search engine indexing.
Current Architecture Issues to Solve:

20-40% potential organic traffic loss from delayed/missed indexing
AI/LLM crawlers cannot access content for citations
Social media previews not working (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn)
Large JavaScript bundle (589.81 kB) hurting Core Web Vitals
FAQ schemas and structured data not properly recognized by search engines

Implementation Requirements:
1. SSG Framework Selection:

Recommend optimal SSG solution that works with existing React/Wouter setup
Consider Next.js, Astro, or other frameworks compatible with Vercel
Minimize code refactoring while maximizing SEO benefits

2. Page Pre-rendering:

Pre-render all guide pages at build time
Ensure full HTML content (including text, headings, FAQ schemas) is available immediately
Maintain existing component structure and styling

3. Routing & Navigation:

Preserve current URL structure: /guides/plantar-fasciitis/training-guide
Maintain inter-chapter navigation functionality
Ensure all internal links work properly in SSG environment

4. Structured Data Preservation:

Ensure FAQ schemas are rendered in initial HTML
Preserve all meta tags and SEO elements
Maintain LLM optimization features (direct answer blocks, question headings)

5. Performance Optimization:

Reduce JavaScript bundle size for better Core Web Vitals
Implement code splitting if needed
Optimize for First Contentful Paint and Largest Contentful Paint

Specific Implementation Steps:

Framework Migration Plan:

What SSG framework to use and why?
Migration strategy from current React/Wouter setup
How to preserve existing components and styling


Build Configuration:

Configure pre-rendering for all guide pages
Set up proper routing for SSG environment
Optimize build process for Vercel deployment


Content Integration:

Ensure all guide content renders in initial HTML
Maintain component hierarchy and data flow
Preserve interactive elements where needed


SEO Enhancement:

Verify structured data appears in pre-rendered HTML
Ensure meta tags are properly set for each page
Optimize for social media preview cards



Success Criteria:

All guide content visible in page source (View Source shows full content)
Search engine crawlers can index content immediately
Social media preview cards work properly
Improved Core Web Vitals scores
AI/LLM crawlers can access and cite content

Deliverables:

Complete SSG implementation with preserved functionality
Updated build configuration for Vercel
Performance optimization recommendations
SEO verification checklist

Priority:
Critical - This addresses a major SEO limitation that could be costing significant organic traffic and preventing AI discovery of the valuable content.
