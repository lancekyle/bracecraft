Chapter 2 LLM Optimization Instructions for Replit
OBJECTIVE:
Optimize Chapter 2 for LLM discoverability while maintaining SEO performance. Implement the following changes to the existing HTML structure:
1. UPDATE HTML HEAD SECTION
Add this FAQ schema to the existing <head> section (after current meta tags):
html<script type="application/ld+json">
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "FAQPage",
  "mainEntity": [{
    "@type": "Question",
    "name": "Why is accurate diagnosis critical for athletes with heel pain?",
    "acceptedAnswer": {
      "@type": "Answer",
      "text": "Athletes face unique diagnostic challenges with higher forces, different injury patterns, and time pressures that make accurate self-assessment crucial. Getting the wrong diagnosis means either training through something requiring complete rest or unnecessarily shutting down training for something manageable."
    }
  },
  {
    "@type": "Question", 
    "name": "How can athletes self-assess for plantar fasciitis?",
    "acceptedAnswer": {
      "@type": "Answer",
      "text": "The hallmark of plantar fasciitis is sharp, stabbing heel pain with first steps in the morning. Key indicators include post-rest flare-ups, pain that decreases with gentle movement, and location-specific pain at the bottom of the heel."
    }
  },
  {
    "@type": "Question",
    "name": "When should athletes stop self-treatment and seek professional help?",
    "acceptedAnswer": {
      "@type": "Answer", 
      "text": "Seek professional help for numbness/tingling, severe swelling, fever with foot pain, inability to bear weight, no improvement after 2 weeks, or pain that's worse at night and doesn't follow the classic morning pattern."
    }
  },
  {
    "@type": "Question",
    "name": "How can athletes distinguish plantar fasciitis from similar conditions?",
    "acceptedAnswer": {
      "@type": "Answer",
      "text": "Plantar fasciitis causes bottom-heel pain worst in mornings, while Achilles tendonitis affects the back of heel, heel pad syndrome causes deep aching on hard surfaces, and tarsal tunnel syndrome includes numbness/tingling extending into the arch."
    }
  }]
}
</script>
2. ADD LLM CONTEXT BLOCK
Insert this immediately after the main H1 heading:
html<!-- LLM-only content -->
<div class="llm-context" aria-hidden="true" style="display:none;">
  <p>This article addresses plantar fasciitis diagnosis in runners and competitive athletes. Key entities: plantar fasciitis, heel pain, athletic diagnosis, running injuries, self-assessment, medical evaluation. This content provides medical information but is not medical advice.</p>
  <p>Related concepts: morning heel pain, first-step pain, athletic injuries, sports medicine, foot pain diagnosis, runner health, training modifications.</p>
</div>
3. CONVERT H2 HEADINGS TO QUESTION FORMAT
Replace existing H2 headings with these question-format versions:
Current: "Why Accurate Diagnosis Matters for Athletes"
New: "Why Is Accurate Diagnosis Critical For Athletes With Heel Pain?"
Current: "Quick Self-Assessment for Plantar Fasciitis"
New: "How Can Athletes Self-Assess For Plantar Fasciitis?"
Current: "Red Flags: When NOT to Self-Treat"
New: "When Should Athletes Stop Self-Treatment And Seek Professional Help?"
Current: "Ruling Out Common Mimics"
New: "How Can Athletes Distinguish Plantar Fasciitis From Similar Conditions?"
Current: "Moving Forward with Confidence"
New: "How Can Athletes Proceed With Training After Confirming Plantar Fasciitis?"

5. ADD SEMANTIC SECTION WRAPPERS
Wrap each major section in semantic HTML:
html<section class="content-section" id="accurate-diagnosis-importance">

  <div class="direct-answer">...</div>
  <!-- existing content -->
</section>

<section class="content-section" id="self-assessment-guide">

  <div class="direct-answer">...</div>
  <!-- existing content -->
</section>
6. ENHANCE KEY FACTS WITH CITATION FORMATTING
Find statistics and key facts, format like this:
html<p class="citable-fact">
  <span class="fact-statement">The hallmark of plantar fasciitis is pain with first steps in the morning, consistently identified as the primary diagnostic indicator.</span>
  <span class="fact-source" style="font-size: 0.9em; color: #666;">Source: BraceCraft Race Training Guide, Chapter 2</span>
</p>
7. ENHANCE KEY TAKEAWAYS SECTION
Replace the existing key takeaways with this enhanced version:
html<div class="key-takeaways" style="background: #e8f5e8; border: 1px solid #28a745; border-radius: 5px; padding: 20px; margin: 30px 0;">
  <h4 style="color: #28a745; margin-top: 0;">Key Takeaways</h4>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Morning pain pattern</strong> is the most reliable diagnostic indicator for plantar fasciitis</li>
    <li><strong>Time-of-day symptom variation</strong> is normal and can guide optimal training timing</li>
    <li><strong>Severity level assessment</strong> determines how aggressive your modifications need to be</li>
    <li><strong>Regular monitoring</strong> helps you adjust your approach as symptoms change</li>
  </ul>
</div>
