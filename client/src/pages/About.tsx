                BraceCraft was born from a simple frustration: too many athletes were getting injured due to 
                lack of proper guidance, and too many were struggling to recover because they didn't have 
                access to expert advice.
              </p>
              <p className="leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Dr. Sarah Chen, our co-founder, noticed this pattern while working with Olympic athletes. 
                The same injuries that could sideline a recreational runner for months could be prevented 
                or treated quickly with the right knowledge and exercises. The problem wasn't lack of 
                effective treatmentsâ€”it was lack of access to expert guidance.
              </p>
              <p className="leading-relaxed mb-6">
                That's when the idea for BraceCraft was born: What if we could make expert sports medicine 
                knowledge accessible to everyone? What if a weekend warrior could access the same quality 
                injury prevention strategies used by professional athletes?
              </p>
              <p className="leading-relaxed">
                Today, BraceCraft combines the expertise of licensed physical therapists, sports medicine 
                doctors, and certified athletic trainers to provide comprehensive, evidence-based guidance 
                for injury prevention and recovery. Our content is created by experts, reviewed by medical 
                professionals, and designed to be actionable for athletes at every level.
