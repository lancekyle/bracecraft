            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Why This Guide Exists</h2>
            <p>
              If you're reading this, you're likely facing one of the most frustrating scenarios in athletics: 
              plantar fasciitis threatening to derail your race goals. You've probably been told to "rest until 
              it heals" or "just take some time off." For competitive athletes, this advice feels impossible and, 
              frankly, inadequate.
            </p>

            <p>
              This guide was born from a simple reality: competitive athletes don't stop training. You shouldn't 
              have to choose between your athletic goals and long-term foot health. With the right approach, you 
              can continue training, compete in your target races, and actually accelerate your recovery process.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">What Makes This Different</h2>
            <p>
              Unlike generic plantar fasciitis advice that assumes you'll simply stop all activity, this guide 
              acknowledges your reality as a competitive athlete. Every recommendation considers:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>Your upcoming race schedule and training commitments</li>
              <li>The psychological impact of complete training cessation</li>
              <li>Sport-specific movement patterns and demands</li>
              <li>Evidence-based recovery acceleration techniques</li>
              <li>Practical gear and training modifications that actually work</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Your Journey Through This Guide</h2>
            <p>
              This comprehensive guide contains 7 core chapters, each building on the previous to create a 
              complete training and recovery system:

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4 mt-8">How to Use This Guide</h2>
            <p>
              While each chapter builds on the previous, you can also reference specific sections based on your 
              immediate needs. However, I strongly recommend reading Chapters 1-2 first, as they establish the 
              foundation for all subsequent recommendations.
            </p>

            <p>
              Throughout this guide, you'll find practical assessments, decision trees, and action steps marked 
              with clear visual cues. Don't just read passivelyâ€”engage with the assessments and implement the 
              strategies systematically.
            </p>
