      <h1>Chapter 1: Why Standard Advice Fails Athletes</h1>
      <div class="meta">By Dr. Lance Kyle | 12 min read | Updated June 18, 2025</div>

      <p>"Just rest until it heals." If you're a competitive athlete with plantar fasciitis, you've heard this advice countless times. Here's why it's not just inadequate—it's counterproductive for serious athletes.</p>

      <h2>The Standard Medical Model vs. Athletic Reality</h2>
      <p>Traditional plantar fasciitis treatment assumes patients can completely stop aggravating activities. For competitive athletes with training schedules, race commitments, and performance goals, this approach creates more problems than it solves.</p>

      <div class="faq">
        <h3>Why doesn't rest work for competitive athletes with plantar fasciitis?</h3>
        <p>Complete rest often leads to deconditioning, psychological stress, and doesn't address the underlying biomechanical issues that caused plantar fasciitis in competitive athletes.</p>
      </div>

      <h2>Why Complete Rest Backfires for Athletes</h2>
      <h3>1. Deconditioning Cascade</h3>
      <p>When competitive athletes stop training completely, they experience rapid deconditioning affecting cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, and neuromuscular systems within days to weeks.</p>

      <h3>2. Psychological Burden</h3>
      <p>Research shows that athletes forced into complete rest experience increased anxiety and depression scores within 2 weeks, along with loss of athletic identity and self-efficacy.</p>

      <h3>3. Biomechanical Deterioration</h3>
      <p>Plantar fasciitis in athletes is rarely just about the plantar fascia—it's typically a symptom of broader biomechanical dysfunction that complete rest doesn't address.</p>

      <h2>Evidence-Based Reality: What Actually Works for Athletes</h2>
      <p>Recent research consistently shows that graduated, progressive loading protocols produce better outcomes for athletic populations than complete rest approaches.</p>
