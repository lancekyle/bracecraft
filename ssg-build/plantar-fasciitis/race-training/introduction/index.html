      <h2>About the Author</h2>
      <p><strong>Dr. Lance Kyle</strong> is a sports medicine specialist with over 15 years of experience treating competitive athletes. As a former collegiate runner and current triathlete, he understands the psychological and physical challenges of training through injury.</p>

      <h2>Why This Guide Exists</h2>
      <p>If you're reading this, you're likely facing one of the most frustrating scenarios in athletics: plantar fasciitis threatening to derail your race goals. You've probably been told to "rest until it heals" or "just take some time off." For competitive athletes, this advice feels impossible and, frankly, inadequate.</p>

      <h2>What Makes This Different</h2>
      <p>Unlike generic plantar fasciitis advice that assumes you'll simply stop all activity, this guide acknowledges your reality as a competitive athlete. Every recommendation considers your upcoming race schedule, training commitments, and psychological needs.</p>

      <h2>Your Journey Through This Guide</h2>
      <p>This comprehensive guide contains 7 core chapters, each building on the previous to create a complete training and recovery system for competitive athletes with plantar fasciitis.</p>
