      <p>Before you can effectively treat plantar fasciitis as a competitive athlete, you need to understand exactly what you're dealing with. This chapter provides comprehensive assessment tools designed specifically for athletic populations.</p>

      <h2>Athletic Plantar Fasciitis: Beyond Basic Diagnosis</h2>
      <p>Athletic plantar fasciitis is rarely just about the plantar fascia. It's typically part of a broader kinetic chain dysfunction that requires comprehensive assessment to address effectively.</p>

      <div class="faq">
        <h3>How do I know if my heel pain is actually plantar fasciitis?</h3>
        <p>Athletic plantar fasciitis typically presents with morning heel pain that improves with movement, pain after periods of rest, and specific tender points along the plantar fascia insertion.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq">
        <h3>What assessments should competitive athletes use for plantar fasciitis?</h3>
        <p>Athletes need sport-specific assessments including loading tolerance tests, biomechanical analysis, training load evaluation, and functional movement screening.</p>
      </div>

      <h2>Comprehensive Athletic Assessment Protocol</h2>
      <h3>Phase 1: Pain and Function Assessment</h3>
      <p>The Athletic Pain Scale (APS) rates pain scenarios from 0-10 across different training intensities and timeframes specific to competitive athletes.</p>

      <h3>Phase 2: Biomechanical Assessment</h3>
      <p>Single leg loading tests assess plantar fascia tolerance to athletic loading patterns, including calf raise tolerance, hop testing, and windlass mechanism assessment.</p>

      <h3>Phase 3: Training Load Analysis</h3>
      <p>Systematic evaluation of recent training load changes, including volume increases, intensity modifications, surface changes, and equipment variations.</p>

      <h2>Creating Your Athletic Profile</h2>
      <p>Based on assessment results, athletes fall into specific plantar fasciitis profiles that guide targeted treatment approaches in subsequent chapters.</p>
